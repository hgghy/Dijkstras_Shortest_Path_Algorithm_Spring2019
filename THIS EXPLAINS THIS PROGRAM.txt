
Sorry about the weird filename, but I wanted to make sure that this got read.

This program is a demonstration of an edge-vertex graph and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
It prompts the user to enter any number of edges (vertices are inferred therefrom) and their weights.
After any number of such entries, it outputs a list containing the shortest path to each vertex.

The program was written as a weekly assignment in spring 2019.
This is not the original repository, because that one has a confusing name on orders from the professor 
to whom the project was submitted.
I have not changed a single line from the way it was at the time, exept I've added this explanation.
